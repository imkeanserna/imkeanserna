"I always say to myself, 'I want to become the best 🔥, just like Yuta Okkotsu.'"

I aim for nothing less than excellence in code quality and seamless functionality. The relentless pursuit of new technologies drives my projects, and I'm constantly learning to stay ahead. Off the keyboard, I'm on the court, channeling the greatness of LeBron James 🐐.

- 🎯 Adaptable full-stack skills tailored to each project.
- 🧠 Diving deep into Web3 (specifically Solana) and mastering Rust.
- 🤝 Eager to collaborate with fellow devs and designers to create cutting-edge products.
- 😎 "I use Debian btw," with Neovim and Vim.
- 💡 Dedicated to solving more DSA challenges.
